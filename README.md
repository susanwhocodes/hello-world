Hi!

How are you? Not doing so hot, eh? Though really, you're too hot. I bet you hate that. But that's ok, World, we are but puny humans. We change your temperature by a few degrees and look how many of us you kill with severe weather. You existed long before we ever did, and you will out last us all by far.
